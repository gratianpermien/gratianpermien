# Hello, hi, moin!
### Welcome to my GitHub.

A huge fan of analytics, structure, good design and creativity, I thrive with fluid and flawless organizations and a high degree of automation with structure and efficiency being my guiding principles, which is why I recently started diving into web development recently. I'm patient and encouraging with people, providing help and feedback where needed. Having been in energy, biotechnology, e-commerce, startup funding, digital marketing, recruiting and van rentals (where‚Äôs Wally?) people consider me a very versatile person with a knack for discovering opportunities.
In my COO role I helped build and streamline one of the major Amazon online marketing agencies in the DACH region. These days I am running a Social Recruiting provider, again a fully remote and semi-automated organization, building processes and operations to achieve maximum efficiency while constantly surprising our B2B customers with the little extra. Covid-19 allowed me to jump into building the operations of a van rental business from scratch while, every now and then, doing interim management gigs for SMEs such as BEMS Ventures, Sovido, PrimeUp and others.
I love making music and manage a chamber choir, klubkonsonanz.de, while having initiated and volunteering with 1. Deutscher Stromverein, fighting the most pressing issue of our time: the climate catastrophe.

üåç üåè üåé We don't change the world by simply looking at it. We change it by the way we choose to live in it.
